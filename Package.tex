Rename Package Refactoring (RpR) changes the name of the package and all references to that package to the new name without changing its behavior.
There are certian preconditions required for RpR.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The target package cannot be duplicate with any existing package name within same project folder. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The target package cannot be duplicate with any existing package name within same project folder.}

For RpR, we can not use duplicate package name within the same source folder. However, we can run RpR with same package name from different Java Project folders.
