\section{\textbf{Preconditions of Rename Field Refactoring}}
Rename Field Refactoring(RfR) changes the declaration and usages of the field to the new name without changing its behavior.
Fields are the variables of a class i.e. instance variables and static variables.
There are certain preconditions required for RfR.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The target name of field cannot be duplicate with any existing field within same class after rename.
	\item The target name of field cannot be duplicate with any local variable within same method after rename.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The target name of field cannot be duplicate with any existing field within same class after rename.}

In order to apply RfR on field, we have to pre-check that the new name of the field is not duplicate with any existing field name of any data type within same class. As shown in Fig. \ref{figure:field}(b), when we apply RfR from \emph{`j' to `i'}, Java compiler produces an error \textit{``variable i is already defined in class A''}. This is because of the conflict for duplicate field declaration for same type variable. As shown in Fig. \ref{figure:field}(c), when we apply RfR from \emph{`s' to `i'}, Java compiler produces an error \textit{``variable i is already defined in class A''}. This is because the compiler will not be able to distinguish between different type variables \emph{`String i'} and \emph{`int i'}.

\subsection{The target name of field cannot be duplicate with any local variable within same method after rename.}
In order to apply RfR on field, we have to pre-check that the new name of field is not duplicate with any local variable name, if field is being used in the same block or method as local variable. 

As shown in Fig. \ref{figure:sameBlock}(a), on executing the output is `0'. However,  after we apply RfR from \emph{`x' to `y'} and on executing Fig. \ref{figure:sameBlock}(b), the output is `5'. Although the compiler did not produce any error but the behavior of code has changed since the output on RfR got changed. 

\begin{figure}[th]
\centering
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java, basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily,frame=single]
class A{

   int x = 0;
   void m(int y){
      System.out.print(x);
   }
	
   void main(String[] args){
      A.m(5);
   }
}
\end{lstlisting}

   void m(int y){
      System.out.print(y);
   }
	
   void main(String[] args){
      A.m(5);
   }
}\end{lstlisting}

Therefore, it is essential to pre-check that the new name of field is not duplicate with any existing local variable if both are used in same block.
